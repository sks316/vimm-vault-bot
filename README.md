This is a Discord bot that I wrote for the Vimm's Lair Discord server. Using it, you can look up games in The Vault, and request people to post new games to The Vault. It also posts new releases in The Vault to a channel in the Vimm's Lair Discord server.

## Self-hosting
Unlike the rest of my bots, self-hosting this one is not supported. It's made for one server in particular, and as of now is intended to be used in that server only. You could argue the same was intended for [sks316/placeholder-chan](https://github.com/sks316/placeholder-chan), but the difference is I made placeholder-chan unprompted and when I presented it to the server it was intended for, it was rejected. This bot was actually *requested* by staff of the Vimm's Lair server, and so I'm intending for it to be used in one server only. If you still want to run it and want to figure it out yourself, I can't and won't stop you. But you're on your own, I'm not helping you. This code is here for historical purposes, as well as transparency and outside contribution, not for others to self-host it.
